All the code, documentation, results and testing is in the `take_home_coding_challenge.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

*How to Build and Run*

Prerequisites:
 - If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, install here --> `https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html`
 
 1. Clone this repository
 2. Open a Terminal window
 3. Change your working directory to the repository just cloned (/BroadDSP)
 4. Run the command to start a local jupyter notebook
    
    `$ jupyter notebook`
 5. This will open a local jupyter notbook --> click on `take_home_coding_challenge.ipynb`
 6. Run the individual cells sequentially using `Control` + `Enter`. The code printed by the individual cell will print right below that cell.
 7. To run your own test cases follow the intructions located above the last cell
