    "First, we define our request URL with its query parameters. Using the Requests library, we send a GET request with the given URL and query parameters.

If we were to not use the filters we would just be re-writing functionality that the mbta API already offers when we're filtering through the response.

    "For this question, we want to find out how many times one must transfer lines in order to get from stop A to stop B. First, I find the `Stop` object based on the inputed string. Then I get the route that stop belongs to. Conveniently, in question 2 we found which stops have more than 1 route passing through it meaning these stops are our points of transfer. If our start route is the same as our end route then we do not need to switch lines. Otherwise, we need to check which stop we can get to on the same route that allows us to transfer to another line. We do this by keeping track of which route we are currently on and which routes we have already seen. If I am on the green line, I need to find all the stops that have more than 1 line passing through which will allow me to transfer. We check each stop by using our `routes_per_stop` dictionary which gives us other routes we can take from that stop. We want to try the routes we haven't already tried other than the route we came from. Each time we try a route, this simulates transfering to another line so we update our starting location every time we transfer. We know we have reached our destination when our starting location is the same as our ending location."
